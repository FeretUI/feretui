The routes to serve FeretUI
---------------------------

We need 3 routes :

* [GET] client route
* [GET] static files route
* [GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE] action route.

.. note::

    The GET, POST, DELETE is the minimum method to use the actions.
    The other is to add only if you need custom form with theses methods.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Request, Response and Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objects Request, Response and Session are wrapper class. The goal is to
s√©parate and link the three object come from web server to FeretUI.

FeretUI can not know all the web server and can not be adapted for each. We need
a link between them. The responsability to do the link is yours.

Some exemple exist and can copy it or adapt it for your projects.

* :class:`feretui.request.Request`
* :class:`feretui.response.Response`
* :class:`feretui.session.Session`

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Client route
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client route is the route that return the FeretUI client. the route (name and url) is free.

The route should ::

    session = ...  # get the feretui session
    myferet = ...  # get the instance client
    request = Request(session=session, ...)  # get the feretui request
    response = myferet.render(request)  # get the client page
    # return the response formated for the web server

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
static files route
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The static files  route is the route that return the javascript, css, font, images.

the url is /*feretui base url*/static/*filepath*

The route should ::

    filepath = ...  # get the file path
    myferet = ...  # get the instance client
    return myferet.get_static_file_path(filepath)  # return the static file

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Action route
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The action route is used to do action on and with the FeretUI client.

* render page
* execute a page
* ...

the url is /*feretui base url*/static/*action*

The route should ::

    action = ...  # get the action to call
    session = ...  # get the feretui session
    myferet = ...  # get the instance client
    request = Request(session=session, ...)  # get the feretui request
    response = myferet.execute_action(request, action)  # execute the action
    # return the response formated for the web server
