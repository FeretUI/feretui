small web client to build an admin interface or a little backoffice


The goal of this project is to give at the developper the possibility to
create an admin interface for any project.

In the web we often need to create an user interface to the configuration or the 
administration of the project. It is not the core of the project but we don't 
want to add this part in the main user interface.

**django_admin** is a solution for the django developper, but not for the other one.


I don't want to link this project with a framework. I really want to create an admin
backoffice availlable for any framework.

## Installation

Install released versions of FeretUI from the Python package index with
`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ or a similar tool:

```
pip install feretui (Not ready yet)
```

Installation via source distribution is via the ``pyproject.toml`` script:

```
pip install .
```

Installation will add the ``feretui`` commands to the environment.

## Running Tests

To run framework tests with `pytest`:

```
pip install pytest
py.test feretui
```

AnyBlok is tested continuously using `GitHub Action`

## Contributing (hackers needed!)

FeretUI is not ready for production usage, it must be
improved and enriched.
Feel free to fork, talk with core dev, and spread the word !
